# Egyptian Open Source Contribution Analysis

## Project Overview

This project aims to analyze and visualize open source contributions from Egypt, focusing on the Arabic-speaking open source community. The goal is to empower Arabic developers, promote collaboration, and support Arabic language adoption in the open source world.

## Project Objectives

1. **Data Collection and Quality:**
    * Gather reliable data from GitHub.
    * Ensure data completeness and accuracy.
    * Exclude inactive or low-quality projects.
2. **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
    * Analyze the geographic distribution of contributors.
    * Identify popular programming languages and projects.
    * Understand the top industries and technologies being developed.
    * Analyze framework and library usage within Egyptian projects.
3. **Tooling and Automation:**
    * Use Python and relevant libraries for data processing and visualization.
    * Automate data collection for repeatability.
4. **Reporting and Documentation:**
    * Clearly document methodologies, data sources, and limitations.
    * Provide transparent and reproducible analysis results.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into Jupyter notebooks, each focusing on a specific analysis task:

* **Data Collection and Preprocessing:**
    - Collects data from GitHub.
    - Cleanses and prepares data for analysis.
* **Contributor Location Analysis:**
    - Analyzes the geographic distribution of contributors by Egyptian city or area.
* **Top Programming Languages Analysis:** 
    - Identifies the most popular programming languages used in Egyptian projects.
* **Top Projects Analysis:**
    - Identifies the most popular and active open source projects from Egypt.
* **Non-Egyptian Projects with Egyptian Contributors:**
    - Identifies non-Egyptian projects with significant contributions from Egyptian developers.
* **Top Industries/Topics Analysis:**
    - Identifies the top industries or topics covered by Egyptian projects.
* **Top Frameworks and Libraries Analysis:** 
    - Identifies the most frequently used frameworks and libraries in Egyptian projects.
